# Code Style Guidelines for Nairobi AI

## Project Overview
Nairobi AI is a modern web application that serves as a community hub for AI practitioners, researchers, developers, educators, and enthusiasts in Nairobi and beyond. This document establishes the coding standards and style guidelines to ensure a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality codebase.

## Technical Stack
- **Platform:** Web
- **Framework:** React
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - shadcn
  - zustand
  - tailwind

## 1. File Organization

### Directory Structure
- Organize code by features and functionality (e.g., `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/hooks`, `src/utils`).
- Keep configuration and assets in separate directories (e.g., `config/`, `assets/`).

### File Naming Conventions
- Use **kebab-case** for utility and configuration files (e.g., `api-service.js`).
- Use **PascalCase** for React components (e.g., `UserProfile.jsx`).
- Test files should mirror their source file names with a `.test.js` or `.spec.js` suffix.

### Module Organization
- Group related functions and classes in the same module.
- Split large files into smaller, logical modules when they grow too complex.

### Import/Export Patterns
- Use ES6 module syntax with named exports where applicable.
- Prefer absolute imports from the project root to simplify module resolution.

### Code Grouping Within Files
- Group related code blocks (e.g., state variables, helper functions) together.
- Separate external imports, internal imports, and styles with clear line breaks.

## 2. Code Formatting

### Indentation
- Use **2 spaces** per indentation level.

### Line Length
- Limit lines to **80-120 characters** to improve readability.

### Line Breaks and Spacing
- Insert line breaks for long lines and complex expressions.
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.

### Bracket Placement
- Use K&R style: place the opening brace on the same line as the declaration.

### Quotes
- Use **single quotes** for JavaScript strings; for JSX attributes, use double quotes.

### Semicolon Usage
- End statements with semicolons consistently.

### Trailing Commas
- Use trailing commas in multi-line object and array literals for cleaner diffs.

### Comments Formatting
- Use JSDoc for function, class, and method documentation.
- Write inline comments to clarify complex logic; avoid redundant comments.

## 3. Naming Conventions

### Variables and Functions
- Use **camelCase** for variable and function names.
- Name functions to clearly describe their purpose (e.g., `fetchUserData`).

### Classes and Interfaces
- Use **PascalCase** for classes, React components, and interfaces.

### Constants and Enums
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants and enum values.

### File Names
- Use **kebab-case** for non-component files, and **PascalCase** for component files.

### Component Naming
- Components should be named in **PascalCase** (e.g., `DashboardHeader`).

### Test File Naming
- Append `.test.js` or `.spec.js` to test file names, mirroring the source file name.

## 4. TypeScript/JavaScript Guidelines

### Type Annotations
- Use explicit type annotations for functions, parameters, and return values in TypeScript.

### Interfaces vs. Type Aliases
- Prefer interfaces for defining object shapes; use type aliases for unions or more complex types.

### Generics
- Use descriptive names for generics (e.g., `T`, `K`) and constrain them when necessary.

### Null/Undefined Handling
- Utilize optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) to handle null/undefined values.

### Error Handling
- Implement try-catch blocks and error boundaries to manage exceptions.

### Async/Await Patterns
- Use async/await syntax for asynchronous code and always handle potential errors.

### Default Values
- Define default values for function parameters where applicable.

### Optional Chaining
- Use optional chaining to simplify access to nested properties safely.

## 5. Component Guidelines

### Component Composition
- Build small, reusable components that encapsulate specific functionality.

### Props Interface Definitions
- Define clear and strict props interfaces for components using TypeScript.

### State Management
- Use zustand or React's built-in state management effectively. Keep local and global state management separate.

### Event Handling
- Name event handlers with a clear prefix (e.g., `handleClick`, `onSubmit`).

### Lifecycle Methods Usage
- Prefer React hooks over class-based lifecycle methods.

### Custom Hooks Patterns
- Encapsulate shared logic in custom hooks, keeping them focused and reusable.

### Render Optimization
- Use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Error Boundaries
- Implement ErrorBoundary components to gracefully handle rendering errors.

## 6. Documentation Standards

### JSDoc Requirements
- Document functions, components, and classes with JSDoc comments.

### README Structure
- Maintain a comprehensive README with sections on setup, usage, contribution, and troubleshooting.

### Code Comments Style
- Write clear and concise inline comments; avoid over-commenting obvious code.

### API Documentation
- Document API endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples.

### Type Documentation
- Use TypeScript comments and definitions to document complex types.

### Example Usage
- Provide code snippets and examples in documentation to illustrate common patterns.

### Changelog Format
- Maintain a changelog file documenting all major changes and version updates.

## 7. Testing Standards

### Test File Organization
- Co-locate test files with source files or organize them in a dedicated tests folder.

### Naming Conventions
- Name test files to match the corresponding source files (e.g., `Button.test.js`).

### Test Structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test cases for clarity and consistency.

### Mock Data Handling
- Use factories or mock libraries to generate test data; keep mocks maintainable.

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for critical components and business logic.

### Integration Test Patterns
- Write integration tests to validate key user flows and component interactions.

### E2E Test Guidelines
- Utilize tools such as Cypress for end-to-end testing where applicable.

## 8. Performance Guidelines

### Bundle Optimization
- Use Webpack (or a similar bundler) to minimize bundle size and optimize asset delivery.

### Code Splitting
- Implement dynamic imports and code splitting to improve initial load times.

### Lazy Loading
- Lazy load non-critical components to improve performance.

### Memory Management
- Clean up subscriptions, timers, and event listeners to avoid memory leaks.

### State Management
- Optimize state usage to prevent unnecessary re-renders and data fetching.

### Rendering Optimization
- Use React optimization hooks such as `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` judiciously.

### Asset Optimization
- Optimize images and static assets through compression and appropriate formats.

## 9. Security Guidelines

### Authentication Handling
- Implement secure authentication flows with proper session management.

### Data Validation
- Validate all inputs on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks.

### API Security
- Secure API endpoints using authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities using tools like npm audit.

### Environment Variables
- Store sensitive information in environment variables and do not commit them to version control.

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Ensure encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.

### Security Best Practices
- Follow OWASP guidelines and conduct regular security reviews.

## 10. Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Adopt GitFlow or trunk-based development to streamline releases and collaboration.

### Branch Naming
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/login-error`).

### Commit Message Format
- Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add login functionality`, `fix: correct typo in header`).

### PR Requirements
- Ensure pull requests are peer-reviewed with clear descriptions and linked issues.

### Code Review Process
- Conduct thorough code reviews with inline comments and suggestions.

### CI/CD Practices
- Integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to enforce testing and linting.

### Version Control Guidelines
- Use semantic versioning for releases and tag critical milestones.
